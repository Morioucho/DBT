    <h1>Super Saiyan</h1>
    
    <p>Super Saiyan (超スーパーサイヤ人じん Sūpā Saiya-jin) is an advanced transformation utilized by members and hybrids of the Saiyan race that have sufficient amounts of S-Cells in the Dragon Ball series. 
    The Super Saiyan form first debuted on March 19, 1991, within chapter 317 of the Dragon Ball manga, entitled "Life or Death".
    It made its anime debut in June 1991, within Dragon Ball Z episode 95, "Transformed at Last". The transformation occurs when the user experiences strong emotions such as anger or sadness, which causes them to awaken their super saiyan. 
    Once achieving the form, it is easy to go back into it without needing emotion. The power up grant the user at least a 50x multiplier of their original strength.
