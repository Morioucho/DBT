            <h1>Super Saiyan God</h1>
            <p>Super Saiyan God (超スーパーサイヤ人じんゴッド Sūpā Saiya-jin Goddo) is a
                Saiyan transformation that grants the user godly ki, providing them with a
                power boost beyond Super Saiyan 3 and its predecessors. It is initially
                obtained through a ritual involving six righteous Saiyans or special
                divine training. Trained users can further combine this form with the
                first Super Saiyan transformation, attaining the more powerful Super
                Saiyan Blue or Super Saiyan Rosé form (depending on the user's status and
                ki). This form is primarily used to conserve ki while still being able to
                hold up a fight with a formidable opponent, such as Vegeta and Goku using
                the form against the saiyan named Broly. This form was first introduced in
                the "Battle of Gods" movie, which came out in 2013 of August. Much like
                the form Super Saiyan, once the user activates Super Saiyan God, they are
                able to use it at any time without needing to perform a ritual. </p>
