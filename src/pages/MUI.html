            <h1>Mastered Ultra Instinct</h1>
            <p>The form "Mastered Ultra Instinct" was achieved by Goku during the Tournament of Power arc. Initially he
                went "Ultra Instinct Sign" against Jiren, howwever later on he acheived the "Mastered" form. His hair
                turns silver and he loses his shirt. After a period of time fighting Jiren, he loses this form due to
                too much power.</p>
