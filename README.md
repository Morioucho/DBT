# DBT
> A demo Springboot project about Dragon Ball Transformations.
DBT is an example Springboot app that features a simple backend and frontend
for the sake of understanding how Springboot works and key components that 
Springboot offers.

# About
DBT offers information about Dragon Ball characters such as their power-ups, feats, transformations, and other relevant information. Since DBT is a demo project, there are only a few characters in storage.

# Building
In order to run the program, you can simply open the "index.html" file. Running the file
should automatically have the website up and running on your local machine.
